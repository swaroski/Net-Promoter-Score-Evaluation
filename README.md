# Net-Promoter-Score-Evaluation
This model showcases how to evaluate customer satisfaction from online reviews at scale. One can identify information about the market's sentiment for a product or service from survey results.  Process: a product was selected at random from those containing over 75 reviews(Amazon's dataset). Reviews were then segmented for investigation by sentiment analysis score. Exploring the review score's top and bottom tiers, clear insights emerge for actionable improvements.
